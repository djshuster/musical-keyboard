## What Is It?
### Multiple Instruments
In short, you can play a bunch of different instruments. Below, you can see a pitched helicopter-sounds "instrument" in use. Funky! <img src="Images/helicopter-screenshot-0.jpg" alt="musical keyboard program with helicopter-sound instrument" width="40%" height="40%"/>

### Load Tracks
You can also load in MIDI files for your listening pleasure, or you can use them as backing tracks!
